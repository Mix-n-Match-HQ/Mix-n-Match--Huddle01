## Supercharge your community with live stranger meeting iframe infrastructure
Application to meet and chat with random strangers online.

This can be useful for individuals who are looking to expand their social circle, meet new people from different parts of the world, or simply have a fun and spontaneous conversation with someone they have never met before.

The iframe version of this app allows people to embed it on their own website or community, providing a way for website owners to offer their visitors an interactive and engaging way to connect with others. 

By using the iframe code provided by your application, website owners can add your Omegle-like chat feature directly to their website, without the need for their visitors to navigate away to a separate website.

The advantages of using an iframe include:

- Seamless integration: By embedding your chat feature within their website, website owners can offer a seamless and integrated experience for their visitors, without the need for them to navigate to a separate website.

- Increased engagement: By providing an interactive and engaging way for their visitors to connect with others, website owners can increase engagement and time spent on their website.

- Expanded reach: By offering your chat feature on their website, website owners can expand their reach and attract new visitors who may be interested in using your application.

- To use the iframe feature of your application, website owners simply need to copy and paste the iframe code provided by your application into their own HTML document. They can then customize the appearance and behavior of the chat feature to match their website's design and branding.
